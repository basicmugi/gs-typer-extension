How to install locally:

Chrome:
Step 1: Go to Extensions
Step 2: Look for "Load unpacked" button
Step 3: Load the folder
Step 4: Success!!

Firefox:
Step 1: Go to about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
Step 2: Upload the maifest.json under 'Load Temporary Add-on'
Step 3: Success!!

Notes: 
I'm waiting for firefox dev to approve the add-on, I will update when it's ready. 
I'm not uploading to Chrome Dev because it requires a 5$ registeration fee and I'm not paying Google a cent.
